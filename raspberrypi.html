        Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board 
        computers developed in the United Kingdom by the
         Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.
          Since 2013, Raspberry Pi devices have been developed 
          and supported by a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi 
          Foundation, now named Raspberry Pi Ltd.
